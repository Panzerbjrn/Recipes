3) Loosen the skin from the meat by hand.
4) Season the meat, under the skin, with rub. Season the inside of the cavity as well as the skin.
5) When the beer is warm, place the chicken upright, on the canister. 
6) Cook on the smoker until the internal temperature in the breasts reaches 165°F (about 2.5 hours for a 4-5 lb. bird).
7) Immediately after removing the bird from the cooker, glaze the outside with BBQ Sauce.
