Ok, Veggie gratin (yummy & healthy)

Ingredients:
Frozen veggies. Cooks choice, but personally, I only use Broccoli and Cauliflower.
Eggs. Lots and lots of eggs. Ok, maybe only 6-12 depending on how big your dish is.
Cheese. All the cheese in the world. Or however much you need to cover the dish.
Cream or milk. 1dl or so. Less or more as cook wants it.

1) Whisk eggs + milk/cream/both in a bowl.
2) Put the frozen veggies in an oven prrof dish (Like pyrex).
3) Pour eggs mix over veggies.
4) Cover with cheese.
5) Cook in pre-heated oven at 175-220 degrees for 45+ minutes.
Leave to cool down. Eat. Bask in the glow of how healthy you are, and how much better than other people your food choices are. You're a giant amongst midgets. Crush them.

The picture is so you can see an eaten example of the final product :-D

Notes on cooking:
1 - Add whatever spices you feel like to the egg/milk mix. I add black pepper, crushed garlic, paprika, cayenne pepper, Lea & Perrin's, oregano and literally *whatever* I feel like...
2 - If you like your veggies crunchy, use frozen. If you like them squishy, let them thaw first.
3 - Again, add "stuff". Same as in step 1. I like to add whole cloves of garlic. Also, keep stirring while pouring, to avoid "clumoing".
4 - Thick or thin covering, doesn't matter. Depends on how cheesy you like your food ;-)
5 - The hotter the oven, the darker the cheese will get, and the more milk/cream, the longer it will need in the oven. If I add milk, I will usually end up giving the dish about 70-90 minutes at 180ish degrees.
