For the marinade

1 cup, Plain Yogurt
1 tbsp, Lemon Juice
2 tsp, Garam Masala
1 tsp, Ground Red Chili Powder
1 tsp, Ground Coriander
1 tsp, Turmeric
½ tsp, Salt
1.5 lbs, Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs cut into bite side pieces.
3 tbsp, Clarified Butter

Sauce

½ cup, Butter cut into cubes
2 cups, Tomato Sauce
1 tbsp, Sugar
1 tsp, Ground Red Chili Powder
2 tbsp, Dried Fenugreek Leaves
1 tsp, Garam Masala
2 cups, Heavy Cream
Salt to Taste


1 - Combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl, cover and marinate overnight, or a minimum of 2 hours.
2 - In a large Dutch Oven, add Clarified Butter and heat on high. Add chicken in batches, ensuring not to crowd the pan, and sear on all sides, creating a deep brown crust.
3 - Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
4 - Using the same dutch oven, melt ¼ cup of butter and add Tomato Sauce, Sugar, Red Chili, 1 tbsp of Fenugreek Leaves, and Garam Masala.
5 - Stir, and scrape all the bits of spice leftover from frying the chicken in the pan.
6 - Continue to cook until tomatoes reduce, thicken, and butter begins to separate (approximately 15-20 minutes).
7 - Add remaining Butter, Heavy Cream (reserving a few tablespoons), and Salt to taste.
8 - Return chicken to pan, bringing the mixture to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes until chicken is cooked through.
9 - Garnish with remaining Dried Fenugreek Leaves, and a drizzle of Heavy Cream.
