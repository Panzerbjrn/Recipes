Ingredients

    3 medium sized potatoes
    3 cloves garlic
    1 egg yolk
    1/2 tsp lemon juice 3 ml
    1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 120 ml
    2 tbsp finely chopped parsley 8 grams
    sea salt

Instructions

    Cut the potatoes (peeled & washed) into small pieces that are 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick, add the cut potatoes into a stock pot, making sure theyÂ´re in a flat layer, fill with cold water, just enough to barely cover the potatoes, season generously with sea salt and heat with a high heat

    After 14 to 15 minutes the potatoes should be perfectly cooked, pierce them with a toothpick, if it easily goes in but with some resistance, they are perfect, remove from the heat and drain into a colander, shake off any excess water and let them sit at room temperature

    Meanwhile make the aioli, add in 3 cloves garlic (roughly chopped) into a mortar, pinch in some sea salt and using a pestle mash down until you form a paste, then add in 1 egg yolk at room temperature and squeeze in 1/2 tsp lemon juice, start mixing everything together in a circular motion, at the same time start slowy adding in 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, once all the olive oil has been added and you end up with a thick and creamy sauce, the aioli is done

    Transfer the potatoes into a large bowl, pour the aioli over the potatoes and add in 2 tbsp finely chopped parsley, gently mix together until each piece of potato is coated in the aioli & parsley, serve at room temperature or add into the fridge for 30 minutes and serve chilled, enjoy!
