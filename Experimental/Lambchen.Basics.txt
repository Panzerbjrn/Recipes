Trim the silver skin from the surface of the meat.
Remove the membrane from the back side of the ribs, if present. Season the lamb with Oakridge BBQ Black Ops.

Heat a Lodge Logic 12” cast iron skillet over high heat.
Add the vegetable oil. Sear the meat surfaces of the lamb in the skillet until browned (a couple of minutes for each side).
Remove from the pan.

Combine the whole pistachios and parmesan in a food processor.
Process until broken down into small chunks.
You want some texture, but not big chunks of pistachio.
Combine the pistachios and parmesan with the bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary and olive oil, as well as two teaspoons of the Oakridge BBQ Black Ops.
Mix well.

Slather the lamb with the House of Q Slow Smoke Gold Mustard Sauce.
You’ll need about 1/4 cup total.
Brush to spread evenly across the surface.
Coat the meat of the lamb well with the pistachio mixture.

Grill the rack of lamb on the second shelf of your Yoder Smokers YS640 pellet grill at 400°F until the internal temperature reaches 120°F, about 15 minutes.
Remove from the grill.
Rest 5-10 minutes before slicing.
Slice between the bones to serve as chops.
