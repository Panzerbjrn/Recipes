2 cups Hot Sauce
1 bottle of Zesty Italian Dressing
½ cup Soy Sauce
½ cup Worcestershire Sauce.

Add wings to large zip lock bag.
Mix Hot Sauce, Zesty Italian Dressing, Soy Sauce, and Worcestershire Sauce.
Pour into the bag with the wings. Squeeze air out and toss the wings around so the marinade covers everything.
Place in a fridge for at least 3-4 hours up to overnight.
Remove from bag, let excess marinade drip off, and arrange on rack.
Season each side with a light dose of rub.
Get smoker up to 275f and place wings on the grates.
Smoke wings for 1 hour, flip the wings; add a little extra rub if you feel like it.
Cook an additional 30-60min, wings should be done now.
Toss in sauce if you want.
Enjoy!
