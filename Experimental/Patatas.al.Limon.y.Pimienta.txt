Ingredients

1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 60 ml
2 potatoes
1/2 onion
4 cloves garlic
2 cups vegetable broth 473 ml
1 lemon
handful fresh parsley
dash sea salt
dash black pepper

Instructions

Heat a large fry pan with a medium heat and add in 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

While the olive oil is heating, cut 2 medium sized potatoes (cleaned & patted dry) into 1/4 inch (.635 cm) thick slices

After heating the olive oil for 4 minutes, add the sliced potatoes into the pan, making sure they´re all in a single layer (cook in batches to not over-crowd the pan), after 3 minutes flip to fry the other side, after a total cook time of 6 minutes, remove the potatoes from the pan, continue to cook the rest of the sliced potatoes until they´re all done, then set aside

Using the same pan with the same heat, add in 1/2 onion finely diced and 4 cloves garlic roughly chopped, mix with the olive oil, after 3 minutes and the onion is translucent, add the slices of potato back into the pan, they can be layered over each other, then pour in enough vegetable broth to just barely cover the potatoes, turn up the fire to a high heat, shake the pan once in a while so the garlic & onion are evenly mixed with the potatoes

After about 15 minutes and most of the broth has been absorbed by the potatoes, remove the pan from the heat, you can always pierce the potatoes with a toothpick to ensure they are fully cooked

Season the potatoes with sea salt, the zest of 1/2 a lemon, a generous portion of freshly cracked black pepper and a sprinkle of finely chopped parsley, enjoy!
