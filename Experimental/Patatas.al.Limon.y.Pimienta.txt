Ingredients

1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 60 ml
2 
1/2 onion
4 cloves garlic
2 cups vegetable broth 473 ml
1 lemon
handful fresh parsley
dash sea salt
dash black pepper

Instructions
Prep:
1) Cut 2 medium sized potatoes (cleaned & patted dry) into 1/4 inch (.635 cm) thick slices
2) Dice onion finely
3) Roughly chop garlic

1) Heat a large fry pan with a medium heat
2) Add in 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, heat the olive oil for 4 minutes
3) Add the sliced potatoes into the pan, making sure theyÂ´re all in a single layer (cook in batches to not over-crowd the pan)
4) After 3 minutes flip to fry the other side for 6 minutes total
5) Remove from pan, cook the rest of the potatoes, then set aside
6) Add onion and garlic, mix with the olive oil, cook 3 minutes
7) The onion is translucent, add the slices of potato back into the pan, they can be layered over each other
8) Then pour in enough vegetable broth to just barely cover the potatoes, turn to high heat, shake the pan once in a while so the garlic & onion are evenly mixed with the potatoes
9) After 15 minutes and most of the broth has been absorbed by the potatoes, remove the pan from the heat, you can always pierce the potatoes with a toothpick to ensure they are fully cooked

Season the potatoes with sea salt, the zest of 1/2 a lemon, a generous portion of freshly cracked black pepper and a sprinkle of finely chopped parsley, enjoy!
