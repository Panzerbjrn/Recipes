Endless rum pour pina colada

for one standard blender pitcher

2 cansof coconut milk

half a 46 oz can of pineapple juice (for you metric system folks....figure it out)

1/2 to 1 full lime squeeze (depending on how tart you want it, how much to cover up alcohol taste)

1 banana

toasted coconut flakes (for additional flavor)

LOTS of ice

Rum / 151 Rum (if you want to get crazy, add 1 or 2 shots of everclear or replace rum with wild turkey)

Malibu (for sweetness and additional rum.....tho more like candy than rum)



Blend in parts (juices first, then ice and other ingredients) or blend all at once depending on how icey or slush or liquid you want it to be. Enjoy!
